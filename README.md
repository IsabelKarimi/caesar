BDD
On the user keying in a string a shift will be given to us, with respect to each letter in the string, which will be applied to encrypt our message. This means that any letter x is equal to (x + 2), where 2 is the shift number and x is a character. Decoding is the vice versa of encoding where an example includes:
If a string "ab" is keyed in the encription output will be "cd". On decoding "cd" the output will be "ab"
